## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add correlation identifiers to logs in execution/error flows.
- [x] 1.2 Log gate state changes with reason (continue/map gates).
- [x] 1.3 Log start/end of key waitpoints: idle-between-maps, skip-reset, ask-repeat reset, completion End reset.
- [x] 1.4 Verify logs reconstruct map->steps->error->resolution->next map chain.
