The user wants me to move the file name display in the TestSequenceEditor.razor component to be in the header/title bar area, similar to what's shown in the image. Looking at the image, I can see "Sub Modules to run in parallel" is the header text, and there appears to be a title bar at the top showing the file name.

The user also mentions that the original shows "sqc" but their application will use "xlsx" format.

Let me look at the current code structure to understand what needs to be changed:

1. Currently the file name is shown inline with "Sub Modules to run in parallel" text in the `area-top-header` div
2. The user wants it displayed more prominently, like in a window title bar

Looking at the image more carefully:
- There's a window with a title bar that says "Sub Modules to run in parallel" and has an X close button
- The file name should probably be shown in this title bar area

Let me also check the CSS file to understand the layout better.</details></think>

Now I understand the layout. Looking at the image again:
- The window has a title bar at the very top showing the file name with the window close button (X)
- Below that is the "Sub Modules to run in parallel" header

Currently, the file name is displayed inline with the "Sub Modules to run in parallel" text in the `area-top-header`. The user wants to ad</details></think>
