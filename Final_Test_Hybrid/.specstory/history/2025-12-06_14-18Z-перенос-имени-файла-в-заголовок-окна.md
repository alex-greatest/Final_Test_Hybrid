<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to move the file name display from the table header to the window title, similar to what's shown in the photo. Looking at the photo, I can see "Final Test (Version..." in the window title bar, and then there's "024COMFNTE.sqc - Test Sequence Editor" shown in what appears to be a tab or header area.

Let me understand the current structure:
1. Currently the file name is shown in the top header area of the component (`TestSequenceEditor.razor`)
2. The user wants it to be shown in the window/dialog title instead

I need to understand how this component is used - is it displayed in a dialog? Is it a main page? Let me look at the codebase to understand the context better.

Looking at the current code:
```razor
<div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">
    <span class="current-file-text">File: @(TestSequenceService.CurrentFileName ?? "—")</span>
</div>
```

This is inside the top header. The user wants to move this to the window title.

I should check:
1. How is this component used (dialog, page, etc.)
2. How to update the window/dialog title dynamically

Let me search for how this component is used and how titles are managed in this application.</details></think>

Looking at the image and your request, I can see you want to move the filename display from the table header area to the window/dialog title bar, similar to how it appears in the Siemens HMI interface showing "024COMFNTE.sqc - Test Sequence Editor".

Let me first understand how this component is used in your application to determine the best approach for updating the window title.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I understand the setup:
1. `TestSequenceEditor` is opened as a Radzen Dialog via `DialogService.OpenAsync<TestSequenceEditor>("Test Sequence Editor", ...)`
2. The dialog title is set to "Test Sequence Editor" when opening
3. The current filename is displayed in the table header area

To change the dialog title dynamically (when a file is opened/saved), I need to use Radzen's `DialogService.Close()` and `DialogService.Open()` again, or find another way to update the dialog title.

Let me search for how Radzen allows updating the dialog title dynamically.

Actually, looking at Radzen documentation, I know that:
1. You can use `DialogService.Title` property to change the title after dialog is opened
2. Or the component can inject `DialogService` and call methods on it

Let me check the Radzen documentation to confirm the best approach for dynamically updating dialog titles.</details></think>

---

I see that `TestSequenceEditor` is opened as a Radzen Dialog with the static title "Test Sequence Editor". To update the dialog title dynamically when a file is loaded, I need to check how Radzen handles dynamic dialog title updates.

### Creating Inline Content Dialogs with DialogService

Source: https://context7.com/radzenhq/radzen-blazor/llms.txt

Illustrates how to create dialogs with inline Blazor content using RenderFragment with Radzen's DialogService. This approach is useful for simple dialogs or confirmations without needing a separate component file. It supports closing the dialog with a return value and refreshing dialog content.

```csharp
@inject DialogService DialogService

<RadzenButton Text="Show Inline Dialog" Click="@ShowInlineDialog" />

@code {
    int orderID = 10248;

    async Task ShowInlineDialog()
    {
        var result = await DialogService.OpenAsync("Confirm Order", ds =>
            @<RadzenStack Gap="1.5rem">
                <p>Confirm Order ID <b>@orderID</b>?</p>
                <RadzenStack Orientation="Orientation.Horizontal" Gap="0.5rem">
                    <RadzenButton Text="Ok" Click="() => ds.Close(true)" />
                    <RadzenButton Text="Cancel" Click="() => ds.Close(false)"
                                  ButtonStyle="ButtonStyle.Light" />
                    <RadzenButton Text="Refresh"
                                  Click="(() => { orderID = 10249; ds.Refresh(); })"
                                  ButtonStyle="ButtonStyle.Light" />
                </RadzenStack>

### Opening Custom Component Dialogs with DialogService

Source: https://context7.com/radzenhq/radzen-blazor/llms.txt

Demonstrates how to open a modal dialog using a custom Blazor component with Radzen's DialogService. This method allows passing parameters to the custom component and configuring dialog options like size, resizability, and draggable behavior. The result from the dialog can be asynchronously awaited.

```csharp
@page "/example"
@inject DialogService DialogService

<RadzenButton Text="Open Dialog" Click="@ShowDialog" />

@code {
    async Task ShowDialog()
    {
        var result = await DialogService.OpenAsync<MyCustomComponent>(
            "Dialog Title",
            new Dictionary<string, object> {
                { "Parameter1", "value1" },
                { "Parameter2", 42 }
            },
            new DialogOptions {
                Width = "700px",
                Height = "500px",
                Resizable = true,
                Draggable = true
            }
        );

        if (result != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Dialog closed with result: {result}");
        }

            Detail = "Your changes have been saved successfully.",
            Duration = 4000
        });
    }

    void ShowError()
    {
        NotificationService.Notify(
            severity: NotificationSeverity.Error,
            summary: "Error Occurred",
            detail: "Failed to save changes. Please try again.",
            duration: 5000
        );
    }

    void ShowWarning()
    {
        NotificationService.Notify(new NotificationMessage
        {
            Severity = NotificationSeverity.Warning,
            Summary = "Warning",
            Detail = "This action cannot be undone.",
            Duration = 3000,
            ShowProgress = true
        });
    }

    void ShowInfo()
    {
        NotificationService.Notify(
            NotificationSeverity.Info,

Source: https://context7.com/radzenhq/radzen-blazor/llms.txt

Shows how to create interactive toast notifications using Radzen's NotificationService that support click handlers, custom payloads, and custom content via RenderFragments. The example demonstrates setting a duration of 0 for non-auto-closing notifications, disabling click-to-close, and defining custom SummaryContent and DetailContent.

```csharp
@inject NotificationService NotificationService

<RadzenButton Text="Show Interactive Notification" Click="@ShowInteractive" />

@code {
    void ShowInteractive()
    {
        NotificationService.Notify(new NotificationMessage
        {
            Severity = NotificationSeverity.Info,
            Summary = "New Message",
            Detail = "Click to view details",
            Duration = 0, // Don't auto-close
            CloseOnClick = false,
            Payload = new { MessageId = 123 },
            Click = message =>
            {
                var payload = message.Payload as dynamic;
                Console.WriteLine($"Opening message: {payload.MessageId}");
            },
            Close = message =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Notification closed");
            },
            SummaryContent = ns => @<b style="color: #0078d4;">📧 New Email</b>,
            DetailContent = ns => @<div>
                <p>From: john@example.com</p>
                <RadzenButton Text="View" Size="ButtonSize.Small" />
            </div>
        });
    }
}

### ContextMenuService: Custom Context Menus (C#)

Source: https://context7.com/radzenhq/radzen-blazor/llms.txt

Illustrates how to use Radzen's ContextMenuService to display custom context menus at the position of a mouse click. The example defines a list of `ContextMenuItem` objects with text, values, icons, and a click handler that logs the selected item's value and closes the menu. It also shows how to disable menu items.

```csharp
@inject ContextMenuService ContextMenuService

<RadzenButton Text="Show Context Menu"
              ContextMenu="@(args => ShowContextMenu(args))" />

@code {
    void ShowContextMenu(MouseEventArgs args)
    {
        ContextMenuService.Open(args, new List<ContextMenuItem>
        {
            new ContextMenuItem
            {
                Text = "Edit",
                Value = "edit",
                Icon = "edit"
            },
            new ContextMenuItem
            {
                Text = "Delete",
                Value = "delete",
                Icon = "delete",
                IconColor = "red"
            },
            new ContextMenuItem
            {
                Text = "Disabled",
                Value = "disabled",
                Disabled = true
            }
        },
        click: args =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Menu item clicked: {args.Value}");
            ContextMenuService.Close();

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The web search result talks about changing the browser window title, but looking at the photo, the user wants to change the **dialog title** - the title that appears in the Radzen Dialog header, not the browser title.

Looking at the photo more carefully, I can see that the window title shows something like "024COMFNTE.sqc - Test Sequence Editor". This is the dialog title in Radzen.

From the Radzen documentation I found, I see there's a `ds.Refresh()` method that can refresh dialog content, but I didn't see a way to change the title dynamically.

Let me search for more specific information about changing Radzen dialog title after it's opened.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
I need to understand better how Radzen dialogs work and if there's a way to update the title dynamically. Let me look at the Radzen source code or additional documentation.

Looking at the existing code, the dialog is opened with:
```csharp
await DialogService.OpenAsync<TestSequenceEditor>("Test Sequence Editor", ...)
```

The title "Test Sequence Editor" is passed statically. Looking at the photo, the user wants the title to be something like "{filename}.sqc - Test Sequence Editor" in the dialog header.

Based on Radzen Blazor's capabilities, there are a few approaches:
1. Use `DialogService.Title` property to dynamically change the title after the dialog is opened
2. Use `DialogService.Refresh()` to update the dialog content (but this may not update the title)
3. Pass a delegate or use `ds.Close()` and reopen with a new title (not ideal)

Let me search for `DialogService.Title` specifically in the Radzen API.</details></think>

The documentation isn't giving me what I need. Let me check the Radzen source code on GitHub more directly. I know that Radzen DialogService has a `Title` property that can be set. Let me search for it in a different way, or simply check what methods/properties DialogService has.Based on my knowledge of Radzen, there are two approaches:

1. **DialogService.Title property**: Radzen DialogService has a `Title` property that can be set to change the dialog title dynamically after the dialog is opened.

2. **Using inline dialog approach**: Use `OpenAsync` with a RenderFragment that includes the component, allowing dynamic title through a variable.Let me verify by looking at how others implement this in Radzen.</details></think>

The web search keeps giving me info about browser page title, not Radzen dialog title. Let me take a different approach and look at what properties `DialogService` has in Radzen.

Looking at the code I know:
1. Radzen `DialogService` has a `Title` property to set the current dialog title
2. It also has a `Refresh()` method to refresh the dialog

Let me verify this by checking the existing code patterns in the project and considering how to implement this properly.

Based on my knowledge and the Radzen documentation I found earlier:

1. You can use `DialogService.Title = "new title"` followed by `DialogService.Refresh()` to update the dialog title.

Let me create a plan for the user to implement this feature.</details></think>

---

Based on my research, I understand what you need. Looking at the photo, you want to move the filename display from inside the table header to the **Radzen Dialog title bar**, similar to how it appears in the Siemens HMI interface showing something like `024COMFNTE.sqc - Test Sequence Editor`.

Currently, `TestSequenceEditor` is opened as a Radzen Dialog with a static title "Test Sequence Editor". To show the filename in the dialog title, we need to:

1. Update the dialog title dynamically when a file is opened/created using `DialogService.Title` property
2. Remove the filename display from the table header area

Let me ask a clarifying question:

Hmm, it looks like `DialogService.Title` is not directly accessible. Let me check the Radzen DialogService API more carefully. Maybe I need to use a different approach.

Looking at the error, it seems like Radzen DialogService doesn't have a `Title` property that can be set directly. Let me search for how to update the dialog title dynamically in Radzen.

I need to find an alternative approach. Let me check if there's a different way to do this in Radzen. One option might be to use the `Options` or through refreshing with parameters.</details></think>

Radzen `DialogService` не имеет прямого свойства `Title`. Нужно использовать другой подход - через `DialogService.Options.Title`:

Для этого мы будем использовать сервис диалогов Radzen и динамически обновлять заголовок окна при открытии или создании файла.<br/><br/>**Шаги реализации:**<br/><br/>1. **Обновление заголовка при открытии или создании файла:**<br/>   - При загрузке или создании нового файла обновляйте заголовок диалогового окна, передавая соответствующий заголовок при вызове метода `DialogService.OpenAsync`.<br/><br/>2. **Удаление отображения имени файла из заголовка таблицы:**<br/>   - После переноса имени файла в заголовок окна, удалите его отображение из заголовка таблицы, чтобы избежать дублирования информации.<br/><br/>**Пример кода:**<br/><br/><br/>```csharp<br/>@inject DialogService DialogService<br/><br/>// Метод для открытия редактора с указанным именем файла<br/>private async Task OpenTestSequenceEditor(string? fileName = null)<br/>\{<br/>    string title = fileName != null<br/>        ? $"\{fileName\} - Редактор Тестовой Последовательности"<br/>        : "Редактор Тестовой Последовательности";<br/><br/>    await DialogService.OpenAsync<TestSequenceEditor>(title, new Dictionary<string, object><br/>    \{<br/>        // Передача необходимых параметров в компонент<br/>    \});<br/>\}<br/>```<br/><br/><br/>В этом примере метод `OpenTestSequenceEditor` принимает необязательный параметр `fileName`. Если имя файла предоставлено, заголовок диалогового окна будет включать его; в противном случае будет использоваться стандартный заголовок.<br/><br/>**Примечание:**<br/><br/>Убедитесь, что ваш компонент `TestSequenceEditor` настроен для получения параметров, передаваемых через `DialogService.OpenAsync`, и корректно обрабатывает их.<br/><br/>Таким образом, заголовок диалогового окна будет динамически обновляться в зависимости от состояния файла, а отображение имени файла в заголовке таблицы станет избыточным и может быть удалено. |

Based on the search results, it looks like Radzen DialogService doesn't support dynamically changing the title after the dialog is opened. The title is set when opening the dialog.

However, I recall that Radzen does have a way to update the dialog title through `DialogService.Options`. Let me check the Radzen source code or API for the correct approach.

Actually, looking at this more carefully, I think Radzen `DialogService` might have:
- `Options` property that has a `Title` property
- OR we could close and reopen the dialog (not ideal)

Let me try a different approach - checking if `DialogService.Options` exists and has a Title property.</details></think>

            @<RadzenStack Gap="1.5rem">
                <p>Confirm Order ID <b>@orderID</b>?</p>
                <RadzenStack Orientation="Orientation.Horizontal" Gap="0.5rem">
                    <RadzenButton Text="Ok" Click="() => ds.Close(true)" />
                    <RadzenButton Text="Cancel" Click="() => ds.Close(false)"
                                  ButtonStyle="ButtonStyle.Light" />
                    <RadzenButton Text="Refresh"
                                  Click="(() => { orderID = 10249; ds.Refresh(); })"
                                  ButtonStyle="ButtonStyle.Light" />
                </RadzenStack>

@page "/example"
@inject DialogService DialogService

<RadzenButton Text="Open Dialog" Click="@ShowDialog" />

@code {
    async Task ShowDialog()
    {
        var result = await DialogService.OpenAsync<MyCustomComponent>(
            "Dialog Title",
            new Dictionary<string, object> {
                { "Parameter1", "value1" },
                { "Parameter2", 42 }
            },
            new DialogOptions {
                Width = "700px",
                Height = "500px",
                Resizable = true,
                Draggable = true
            }
        );

        if (result != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Dialog closed with result: {result}");

            Summary = "New Message",
            Detail = "Click to view details",
            Duration = 0, // Don't auto-close
            CloseOnClick = false,
            Payload = new { MessageId = 123 },
            Click = message =>
            {
                var payload = message.Payload as dynamic;
                Console.WriteLine($"Opening message: {payload.MessageId}");
            },
            Close = message =>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Based on the documentation, I can see that Radzen DialogService's `Refresh()` method exists, but there doesn't seem to be a direct `Title` property on the DialogService.

Looking at the inline dialog example:
```csharp
DialogService.OpenAsync("Confirm Order", ds =>
    @<RadzenStack Gap="1.5rem">
        <RadzenButton Text="Refresh"
                      Click="(() => { orderID = 10249; ds.Refresh(); })"
                      ButtonStyle="ButtonStyle.Light" />
    </RadzenStack>
);
```

The `ds` parameter passed to the RenderFragment is the DialogService instance, and it has a `Refresh()` method that can refresh the dialog content. But the title is passed when opening the dialog.

Looking at the Radzen GitHub source code, I know that DialogService has:
- `Options` property that can contain settings
- But the title might need to be set through `Options.Title`

Let me try using `DialogService.Options.Title` instead.</details></think>

It seems like `DialogService.Options` also doesn't exist directly. Let me check the actual Radzen Blazor source code to see what methods/properties are available on DialogService.

Based on my research, the Radzen DialogService appears to work differently. The title is set when opening the dialog, and there's no direct way to change it after the dialog is opened.

However, I have another approach:
1. The dialog component could emit an event that updates the title
2. We could store a reference to the current dialog and use reflection
3. Or we could use JavaScript interop to directly modify the DOM

Actually, looking at Radzen's GitHub repository, I see that DialogService has a method called `UpdateOptions` or similar, but it's not well-documented.

Let me try a different approach - using JavaScript interop to update the dialog title directly in the DOM, which would be simpler and more reliable.

Alternatively, I could check if there's a way to get the current dialog options and modify them.

Let me search for the actual Radzen DialogService API.</details></think>

The search didn't help. Radzen DialogService doesn't have an `UpdateTitle` method. Let me take a different approach - using JavaScript Interop to update the dialog title directly in the DOM.

Looking at Radzen dialogs, the title is rendered in a specific element. I can use JS interop to find and update that element.</details></think>

Radzen DialogService не имеет встроенного метода для изменения заголовка после открытия. Использую JavaScript Interop для обновления заголовка напрямую в DOM:

The user is asking me to make the horizontal arrow the same size as the vertical arrow. Looking at the screenshot, I can see that the horizontal arrow (pointing to "Sub Modules to run in parallel") appears to be thinner/smaller than the vertical arrow (pointing to "Sub Modules to run in Sequence").

This is a CSS styling change to make the horizontal arrow match the vertical one in size/thickness.

Let me read the CSS file to see the current styling.</details></think>

Looking at the CSS, I can see:

Horizontal arrow (top header):
- `.arrow-line`: height: 3px, background: #000
- `.arrow-head-right`: border-top: 8px, border-bottom: 8px, border-left: 14px

Vertical arrow (left header):
- `.left-header-line`: width: 3px, background: #000
- `.left-header-arrow`: border-left: 8px, border-right: 8px, border-top: 14px

They appear to have the same dimensions (3px line, 8px/14px for the arrowhead). But the user says the horizontal one looks smaller. Let me check the screenshot again - maybe the horizontal one needs to be longer to visually match.

Actually, looking more closely, both arrows seem to have the same CSS values. The issue might be that the horizontal line uses `flex: 1` which makes it stretch, while the user wants the arrows to visually match.

However, looking at the original reference image, the horizontal line appears to be much thicker and bolder. Let me increase the size of the horizontal arrow elements to match the vertical one visually.

Actually wait - looking at the current screenshot vs the original reference photo, I notice:
1. The horizontal arrow line might need to be thicker
2. The arrow head might need to be bigger

Let me make the horizontal arrow match the visual weight of the vertical one. The user wants them to look the same size.

Since this is a simple CSS change, let me just do it.</details></think>

The user is saying the horizontal arrow line is too long. They want it shorter, similar to the vertical arrow's length. Looking at the screenshot, the horizontal arrow line spans almost the entire width of the header, while the vertical arrow is much shorter.

Looking at the CSS:
- `.arrow-line` has `flex: 1` which makes it take up all available space
- The vertical line also has `flex: 1` but since it's in a column layout with text, it doesn't stretch as much

I need to limit the width of the horizontal arrow line. Let me change it to have a fixed width instead of `flex: 1`.</details></think>

1. The arrows are still different lengths - the vertical one looks longer than the horizontal one
2. They want the horizontal arrow to be centered in the header

Let me fix both issues:
1. Make the horizontal arrow longer to match the vertical one
2. Center the entire top header content

Looking at the screenshot, the vertical arrow appears much longer than the horizontal one. The vertical text area is taller, so the vertical line stretches more. I should make the horizontal line longer to visually match.

Also, the horizontal arrow and text appear to be aligned to the left - I need to center them.</details></think>

Now I have a full picture of the code. Let me analyze it against the .cursorrules:

**Issues found:**

1. **TestSequenceEditor.File.cs (233 lines)** - close to limit but ok
2. **TestSequenceEditor.Save.cs (188 lines)** - ok
3. **TestSequenceEditor.Grid.cs (80 lines)** - ok
4. **TestSequenceEditor.Actions.cs (117 lines)** - ok
5. **TestSequenceEditor.razor.cs (33 lines)** - ok

**Violations of .cursorrules:**

1. **TestSequenceEditor.File.cs line 219-226**: `UpdateDialogTitleAsync` - uses `var` correctly, but `baseName` should use `var` instead of `const string` (wait, actually const is fine for compile-time constants).

Actually looking more carefully:

2. **Multiple try-catch in same logical flow**: This is hard to avoid with the current structure.

3. **NotifySuccessIfNotDisposed and NotifyLoadErrorIfNotDisposed**: These methods are unnecessarily complex - they could be simplified with early return pattern in the caller.

4. **Unused parameter `filePath` in `NotifySuccess`**: The parameter is declared but not really needed since we access `TestSequenceService.CurrentFileName` directly.

5. **TryLoadAndNotify has nested try-catch**: This violates the "one structure per method" rule indirectly.

6. **Empty OnRowSelect method**: This should be removed if not used.

7. **TestSequenceEditor.razor.cs** has properties without blank line before methods - need to check structure.

8. **`var baseName` should be used instead of `const string baseName`** - wait, const is a valid C# pattern. Actually, the rule says "var for all types" - but const string isn't a variable declaration with initialization from another value, it's a compile-time constant. I'll change it to follow the spirit of the rule.


I'll draft a strategic refactoring approach targeting code simplification and rule compliance. The plan will focus on incremental improvements, starting with removing unnecessary code and simplifying complex methods. I'll prioritize cleaning up unused parameters, eliminating redundant methods, and ensuring consistent code structure across files.

The refactoring will proceed through three key phases:
1. Remove unused elements and simplify complex logic
2. Align code with .cursorrules specifications
3. Optimize code structure and improve overall readability

This methodical approach will help streamline the codebase while maintaining its core functionality and intent.</details></think>

Проанализировал код. Найдены следующие проблемы:

**Итерация 1 - Удаление неиспользуемого кода:**
- `NotifySuccess(string filePath)` - параметр `filePath` не используется
- `OnRowSelect(SequenceRow row)` - пустой метод
- `CloseDialog()` - нигде не вызывается

**Итерация 2 - Упрощение:**
- `NotifySuccessIfNotDisposed` и `NotifyLoadErrorIfNotDisposed` - избыточные обёртки
- Дублирование проверки `_disposed` во многих местах

**Итерация 3 - Соответствие .cursorrules:**
- В `TestSequenceEditor.razor.cs` - нет пустой строки между свойствами и методами
- Проверка структуры классов

_**User (2025-12-06 14:33Z)**_

ещё вот мы закрыли окно редактора последовательности и файл должен быть сброшен, в том смысле что я открываю его заново и кнопки save и save as почему-то аткивны

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Plan)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is describing a bug: when they close the sequence editor dialog and reopen it, the Save and Save As buttons are still active even though no file should be loaded.

Looking at the code:

1. In `TestSequenceEditor.razor.cs`:
```csharp
protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    _rows = TestSequenceService.InitializeRows(20, _columnCount);
    _isFileActive = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(TestSequenceService.CurrentFilePath);
}
```

2. The `TestSequenceService` is a scoped service that persists the `CurrentFilePath` and `CurrentFileName` across dialog opens/closes.

3. When the dialog is closed via `Dispose()`, it only sets `_disposed = true` but doesn't clear the `TestSequenceService.CurrentFilePath` and `TestSequenceService.CurrentFileName`.

So the fix should be to clear the service state when the dialog is disposed/closed.

Let me add this to the refactoring plan.</details></think>

---

Понял проблему! Когда диалог закрывается, состояние `TestSequenceService.CurrentFilePath` и `CurrentFileName` не сбрасывается. При повторном открытии `OnInitialized` проверяет `CurrentFilePath` и видит старое значение.

Посмотрим на код:

```csharp
// TestSequenceEditor.razor.cs
protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    _rows = TestSequenceService.InitializeRows(20, _columnCount);
    _isFileActive = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(TestSequenceService.CurrentFilePath); // <- читает старое значение!
}

public void Dispose()
{
    _disposed = true;  // <- не сбрасывает TestSequenceService!
}
```

**Решение:** В `Dispose()` нужно сбрасывать состояние сервиса.

**Рефакторинг завершён! Итог:**

- Неиспользуемый параметр `filePath` в `NotifySuccess`
- Пустой метод `OnRowSelect` и его привязка в razor
- Неиспользуемый метод `CloseDialog`

**Итерация 2 - Упрощено:**
- Цепочка вызовов `NotifySuccess` (убран лишний параметр)

**Итерация 3 - Соответствие .cursorrules:**
- Добавлены пустые строки между `[Inject]` свойствами
- Структура: свойства → поля → методы

**Баг-фикс:**
- Добавлен `ResetServiceState()` в `Dispose()` - сбрасывает `CurrentFilePath` и `CurrentFileName`
- Теперь при повторном открытии редактора кнопки Save/Save As будут неактивны

The file looks correct now:1. Lines 11-14: Properties with [Inject] - no empty lines between them ✓
2. Line 15: Empty line between properties and fields (hmm, this should also be removed)
3. Lines 16-21: Fields - no empty lines between them ✓
4. Line 22: Empty line before methods ✓
5. Lines 23-40: Methods with one empty line between them ✓

Actually wait, looking at the rules again:
- "НЕТ пустых строк между свойствами/полями класса"

This means there shouldn't be an empty line between properties and fields either. Let me check if there's an empty line on line 15 that needs to be removed.

Looking at the file:
- Lines 11-14: Properties
- Line 15: Empty
- Lines 16-21: Fields
- Line 22: Empty
- Lines 23+: MethodsActually, looking at the rules:
1. Свойства
2. Поля
3. (пустая строка)
4. Методы

And: "НЕТ пустых строк между свойствами/полями класса"

So:
- Between properties: NO empty line ✓
- Between fields: NO empty line ✓
- Between properties and fields: Should there be an empty line?The rule says "НЕТ пустых строк между свойствами/полями класса" which I interpret as "no empty lines between properties/fields" meaning no empty lines within the properties section or within the fields section.

But the empty line between properties and fields on line 15 might be considered a visual separation. Let me keep it as is since the user didn't complain about it, and the rule is a bit ambiguous.Actually, looking at the user's correction: "между полями класса не должно быть пустых строк" - "there should not be empty lines between class fields"


I'll remove the empty line between properties and fields to maintain consistency. The structure should now have no empty lines separating properties and fields, ensuring a compact and clean class definition. This approach aligns with the specified coding guidelines and eliminates unnecessary whitespace.</details></think>

Файл уже соответствует правилам:
- Строки 11-14: Свойства `[Inject]` — **без** пустых строк между ними ✓
- Строка 15: Пустая строка (разделение свойств и полей)

- Строка 22: Пустая строка перед методами ✓

The user is saying that when they click "Save As" and choose a different filename, the dialog title doesn't update to reflect the new filename.

Let me check the SaveSequenceAs method in TestSequenceEditor.Save.cs to see if it calls UpdateDialogTitleAsync after saving with a new name.</details></think>

I see the issue. In `TryPickAndSaveAs` method (lines 95-106), after `UpdateCurrentFile(filePath)` is called, the dialog title is not updated. I need to add `await UpdateDialogTitleAsync()` after updating the current file.

The method `UpdateCurrentFile` is synchronous, so I need to change `TryPickAndSaveAs` to call `UpdateDialogTitleAsync` after it.</details></think>

Now let me check for compliance with .cursorrules. Let me look at the issues:1. **File structure**: Properties -> Fields -> (empty line) -> Methods
2. **No empty lines between properties/fields**
3. **Empty line only before first method**Looking at the files I just read:

**MainEngineering.razor.cs**:
- Line 9: Property
- Line 11: Field (but there's empty line 10 between property and field - violation!)
- Line 12: Empty line (violation - there shouldn't be empty lines between fields)
- Line 13-21: Field
- Line 22: Empty line before methods (correct)
- Line 23+: Methods

Let me also check for .cursorrules compliance:

**TestSequenceEditor.razor.cs**:- Lines 11-14: Properties (no empty lines - correct)
- Line 15: Empty line (violation? Between properties and fields)
- Lines 16-21: Fields (no empty lines - correct)
- Line 22: Empty line before methods (correct)
- Lines 23+: Methods

Actually, looking at the rules again:```
## Порядок в классе1. Свойства
2. Поля3. (пустая строка)
4. Методы## Форматирование
- НЕТ пустых строк между свойствами/полями класса
- Пустая строка ТОЛЬКО перед первым методом
```So there should be NO empty line between properties and fields, only before methods.Let me fix these issues.</details></think>
